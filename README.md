I thrive on learning and intentionally seeking out challenges that help me grow. This mindset has been essential to my path as a software engineerâ€”I'm naturally curious and always eager to understand the why behind the code. I see tech as a space for collaboration, creativity, and constant innovation. I love the excitement of building âœ¨new featuresâœ¨ just as much as the challenge of tracking down and fixing a tricky bugðŸª².
